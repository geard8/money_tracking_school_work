# money_tracking_school_work
Small solo project as part of learning C# as part of my education.

## Task

Your task is to build a money tracking application. The application will allow a user to enter 
expense(s) and income(s) to the application. Further, they should be able to assign a month to 
an expense or income. They will interact with a text based user interface via the command-line. 
Once they are using the application, the user should be able to also edit and remove items from 
the application. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then restart the 
application with the former state restored.

## Requirements 
The solution must achieve the following requirements: 
- Model an item with title, amount, and month. (Solve the problem where you have to 
distinguish income and expense) 
- Display a collection of items that can be sorted in ascending or descending order. Sorted 
by month, amount or title. 
- Display only expenses or only incomes. 
- Support the ability to edit, and remove items 
- Support a text-based user interface 
- Load and save items list to file 

The solution may also include other creative features at your discretion in case you wish to 
show some flair.
